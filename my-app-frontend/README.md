Restaurant List application


Restaurant List 
The RestaurantList application's back end is constructed with Sinatra and leverages Active Record, while its front end is developed in React.

## Installation

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Usage

Welcome to my Phase-3 project front end.  The focus on this project was the back end, so what a user interacts with is functional, if a bit simple.  When a user visits http://localhost:3000/restaurants, they access a list of individual restaurants that are complete with names, locations and a number of "$" symbols coinciding with the restaurant's price range. 
There is the ability to add a new restaurant to the list via a form at the top of the page.  Each Restaurant instance has two buttons appended to its listing. The first is to delete the restaurant listing and the second redirects you to the details page of the restaurant instance.  
The details page allows a using to read all of the previous reviews left for the establishment as well as add or delete any review. For added functionality, there is a form on the details page that allows you to update/change the restaurant information.
